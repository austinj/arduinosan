## Artisan-compatible arduino sketches and tutorial for sensing bean temp and environmental temp

It's extremely useful when roasting coffee to measure the temperature within the bean mass that you're roasting. However, if you're using a roaster that lacks a thermocouple or thermistor, you need to roll your own solution. Arduino and some fun electronics allow you to do just that. However, since you're collecting those data digitally, you probably also want to record and monitor them digitally as well. Artisan is open-source roasting software that facilitates the generation of roasting curves, which are the core tool for understanding and adjusting a roast as it happens.

There are a handful of solutions out there for solving this fun little niche problem, but most of them aren't very well documented. So, this is an effort to change that.
